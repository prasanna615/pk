nvisiText Steganography
Steganography Banner Python License

InvisiText is a Python-based steganography tool that allows you to seamlessly hide secret messages within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. This project provides an intuitive graphical interface for encoding and decoding hidden data.

🔍 What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data or a physical object to avoid detection. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography hides the existence of the secret message altogether.

✨ Features
Message Encoding: Hide text messages within PNG or JPG images
Message Decoding: Extract hidden messages from previously encoded images
User-Friendly Interface: Simple GUI with file dialogs for easy image and text selection
Minimal Image Alteration: Uses LSB technique to ensure minimal visual changes to carrier images
Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
pip package manager
Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/prasanna615/invisitext-steganography.git
cd invisitext-steganography
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
Running the Application
Execute the main Python file to start the application:

python main.py
Encoding a Message
Click the "Encode" button
Select an image file (PNG or JPG) using the file dialog
Enter your secret message in the text field
Choose a save location for the output image
The encoded image will be saved with your hidden message
Decoding a Message
Click the "Decode" button
Select an image containing a hidden message
The secret message will be displayed on the screen
🔒 Security Considerations
The LSB method provides basic steganographic hiding but is not cryptographically secure
For sensitive information, consider encrypting your message before encoding it
Large messages may cause noticeable changes in the carrier image
