Enhanced Session Password Security System â€“ Key Points
Objective: Prevents shoulder surfing attacks using dynamic password patterns.

How It Works: Users select a pattern-based password during registration; each login presents a randomized character grid to ensure unique session passwords.

Security Benefit: Resistant to direct observation; passwords change each session.

Technology: Implemented using JavaScript.

Applications: Secure authentication for web apps, ATMs, and mobile devices.



Tools & Languages Used
The project is implemented using JavaScript, which is primarily responsible for creating the randomized password grid and handling user interactions.

Why JavaScript?
Dynamic UI Handling: JavaScript enables the generation of a changing password grid at each login, making shoulder surfing attacks ineffective.

Client-Side Execution: Since JavaScript runs in the browser, it allows real-time password pattern validation without unnecessary server requests.

Security Enhancements: The use of hashed positions within the randomized grid ensures that the password cannot be easily predicted or intercepted.
